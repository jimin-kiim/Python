# Exceptions can be raised with arguments that give detail about them.

# In except blocks, the raise statement can be used without arguments to re-raise whatever exception occurred.

# An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you have finished testing the program.
# An expression is tested, and if the result comes up false, an exception is raised.
# Assertions are carried out through use of the assert statement.

# The assert can take a second argument that is passed to the AssertionError raised if the assertion fails.
